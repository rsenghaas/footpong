# Footpong
Footpong is a 2 player 2d-game where each player controls a circle that moves freely inside the playing field. We aim for realistic collisions to make the experience as exciting as possible.

The plan is to have AI players of different difficulty levels which are trained through self-playing (using the ideas of alpha-zero and mu-zero). The tensorflow powered AI is still work in progress.
